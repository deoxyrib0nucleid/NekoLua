### The most braindead and generic VM based lua obfuscator!

Hey! I have been in this community for around 4 months now (Currently September 29, 2024 while writing this) and I want to retire for a little bit and relax, I will eventually come back in the lua obfuscation community but for now, this will be currently my last obfuscation project -from oxidanedev

## How to use?
1. Download the github repository and place it to a folder in your pc
2. Open cmd or powershell
3. Change directory to the folder you placed the obfuscator files (cd C:\something here\something that\obfuscator)
4. Paste your script in "Script.lua"
5. Run on the command line: "lua index.lua" (replace lua with whatever lua shit u have example: luajit, lua5.2)
6. Wait to finish
7. To get output, extract from Output.lua
8. To execute, run the output with "lua Output.lua" (again replace lua with whatever lua shit u have)
9. Enjoy.
